"""
Lung-RADS grading mechanics: 3-stage state machine (nauka/ocena/test).

See /docs/PROXMOX_DEPLOYMENT.md's sibling doc (README.md, "Lung-RADS grading")
for the overall design. Key rule this file enforces: ground_truth_category
and reference_report are NEVER returned by GET /case (only after POST
/submit, for the stage that's supposed to reveal them) -- the whole point of
the 3 stages is what gets revealed and when.

Authorization (README.md flagged this as a real, unfixed gap; this closes
it): every endpoint below used to take student_id as a bare, client-
supplied parameter with nothing checking it actually belonged to the
caller -- any request could read or submit as any student_id. Now every
endpoint takes an unguessable `token` instead, minted once by POST /session
(coordinator-only, see GRADING_COORDINATOR_KEY below) and resolved
server-side to the real student_id via the `sessions` table. student_id/
session_id are never trusted as credentials again from here on -- they're
only ever used for display (the watermark text), which is fine since
displaying the wrong ID isn't a security problem, only trusting it for
grading actions was.

Revocation (issue #104): POST /session/revoke (coordinator-only) deletes a
token before its TTL expires. It exists so the coordinator can undo a token
it already minted when the rest of the session setup fails -- see
scripts/create-session.py, which mints the token before asking Kasm for a
session (Kasm needs the token as container environment, so the order can't
simply be inverted) and now revokes that token whenever that Kasm call fails.
