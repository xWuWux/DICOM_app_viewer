"""Startup configuration validation (issue #97).

Before this module, GRADING_COORDINATOR_KEY was read with a bare
`os.environ[...]` in main.py (missing -> naked KeyError traceback at
import time, no mention of what to do about it) and its VALUE was never
checked at all: an empty or one-character key imported fine, and
`secrets.compare_digest` against a known-empty secret means anyone who
guesses "empty string" can mint session tokens for any student_id.
GRADING_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS had the same shape of problem one level down
(`int(os.environ.get(...))` -> naked ValueError on "8 godzin").

The compose files' `${VAR:?}` guards are NOT the fix being replaced
here: they don't cover a direct `docker run`, CI, or anyone flipping a
compose default to `${VAR:-}` -- this module is the last line of defense
that holds no matter how the process was started.

Every validation failure raises SystemExit with a message that names the
OFFENDING VARIABLE (and, for non-secret values like the TTL, its bad
input) and says how to fix it -- but NEVER echoes the secret's own
value, so the failure message itself can't become another log-leak
vector (issue #93's lesson applied to startup).
