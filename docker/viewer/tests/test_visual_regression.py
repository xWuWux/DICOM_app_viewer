"""
Visual regression tests for the two grading-panel pages
(watermark.html -- Chrome flow, grading-panel.html -- Weasis flow): catch
any change to what a student actually sees, across every meaningfully
distinct panel state (learning/assessment/test forms, their feedback, and
the final results screen).

Uses pytest-playwright-visual-snapshot (pixelmatch under the hood, the
same engine Playwright's own JS visual comparisons use) -- not a hand-
rolled diff, and not the commercial SaaS tool a recent internal reference
article on UI/UX testing pointed at; this is the actively-maintained
open-source equivalent that fits this repo's existing Python+Playwright
stack.

Determinism, the hard part of screenshotting a page with a live-updating
watermark (STUDENT_ID | SESSION_ID | timestamp, re-rendered every second
via setInterval -- see watermark.html/grading-panel.html's own comments):
Playwright's Clock API (`page.clock.set_fixed_time`) freezes what
Date.now() returns *before* the page's own script ever runs, so every
tick of that setInterval renders the exact same string -- no masking
needed, and the watermark itself becomes part of the deterministic
baseline instead of a problem to work around.

watermark.html's own screenshot is deliberately scoped to the
`#grading-panel` element only, not the full page: the DICOM viewer
iframe next to it renders Orthanc's own Explorer2 UI, whose content
depends on Orthanc's actual current data (which sample studies happen to
be loaded) -- real, inherent instability this repo doesn't control,
unrelated to whether *our* UI changed. grading-panel.html has no such
iframe (Weasis shows the images in its own separate window instead, see
README's "Two viewer flows" section), so its snapshot covers the full
page -- the panel_locator fixture below returns the right target for
either page transparently, so tests never need to know the difference.

student_id per test is derived from the test's own (parametrized) node
name -- unique per (test method, flow_page) so watermark.html and
grading-panel.html's own runs of the *same* test method never share one
student_id and silently interfere with each other's progress, but
deliberately fixed/stable across separate suite runs, NOT run-varying
(no timestamp/random suffix): student_id flows straight into the visible
watermark text (STUDENT_ID | SESSION_ID | timestamp), so anything that
changes between runs there would defeat the whole point of a stable
baseline. This is only safe because minting a token does NOT reset a
student's progress, but scripts/test-visual-regression.sh always tears
down the grading-db volume before running -- every real invocation starts
every student genuinely fresh. Found the hard way once, briefly, by
mis-designing this the other way around (a run-unique ID "fixed" a
collision from manual iterative debugging against a live stack, but broke
determinism for everyone else) -- see git history if curious.

Run via scripts/test-visual-regression.sh (self-contained: provisions the
stack, mints tokens, runs this inside the official Playwright docker
image, tears down on exit) -- not directly with a bare `pytest`, unless
the stack is already up (see that script's own header comment).
