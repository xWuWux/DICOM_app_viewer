"""Build the weasis:// URI for the grading-api case that is current right now.

Single source of truth for two callers (issue #185), so the URI built at
session start and the URI built when the case changes can never drift apart:

  - custom_startup.sh        -> first study, passed to Weasis on launch
  - arrange_windows.sh       -> polls /api/case and re-sends the URI when the
                                case pointer moves (Weasis' weasis:// handling
                                is single-instance IPC: a second launch hands
                                the URI to the running instance)

Usage:
    weasis_case_uri.py uri CASE_JSON ORTHANC_URL    # prints the weasis:// URI
    weasis_case_uri.py uid CASE_JSON                # prints the study UID

Exit status (callers rely on it, tests pin it):
    0  success, OR nothing to open. "Nothing to open" prints nothing: the
       case is complete, the study UID is missing/empty, or the UID is not a
       valid DICOM UID. Callers must treat empty output as "keep what is
       shown now", never as "close the study".
    2  usage error
    3  CASE_JSON is not a JSON object (unreachable API, HTML error page, ...)

Why the URI is built this way is documented in custom_startup.sh's header
(Weasis ConfigData.splitArgToCmd, the dicom:rs command wrapped in weasis://).
The study UID goes straight into a command line, so only DICOM UID characters
(digits and dots, at most 64) are accepted; anything else is "nothing to open".
