"""
Full browser-driven E2E test for the Guacamole PoC flow: provisions a
real session (running scripts/provision-guacamole-session.py as a
subprocess, exercising the exact same code path a real coordinator would
use, not a mocked/simplified version of it), drives a real headless
Chromium browser to the returned auto-login link, and confirms:
  - Guacamole's own auto-login (#/?username=...&password=...) actually
    logs the student straight in with no login form shown -- this was a
    real open question before this test existed: research confirmed the
    mechanism is documented, but never confirmed it against this exact
    Guacamole version/setup.
  - The remote-display canvas actually renders real, non-blank pixel
    data -- confirming the whole guacd -> TigerVNC -> Weasis/epiphany
    pipeline works end to end through a real browser, not just the
    lower-level Guacamole-protocol test used earlier to confirm
    KasmVNC's incompatibility and TigerVNC's compatibility.

Needs the full stack running (docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f
docker-compose.guacamole.yml up -d) and docker/guacamole-weasis:poc built
-- this is NOT a unit test, it's the real thing, same spirit as
scripts/smoke-test.sh for the Kasm flow. Teardown
(scripts/teardown-guacamole-session.py) always runs, even on failure, so
a failed run doesn't leave an orphaned container/Guacamole user behind.
